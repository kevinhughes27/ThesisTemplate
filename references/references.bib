references.bib
Copy bibtex references into this file. (this can be done directly from Google scholar!)
Everything outside a bibtex "block" is a comment so none of this text affects the file.
	Use this to your advantage write your notes about papers in here right after the 
	bibtex block!
I like to save the pdfs of the papers in this folder too. Keep the name of the pdf file
and the bibtex key the same for easy referencing!

go!

Example:

@article{opencv,
    author = {Bradski, G.},
    citeulike-article-id = {2236121},
    journal = {Dr. Dobb's Journal of Software Tools},
    keywords = {bibtex-import},
    posted-at = {2008-01-15 19:21:54},
    priority = {4},
    title = {{The OpenCV Library}},
    year = {2000}
}
